## About

This Repository contains all the models I coded from scratch for as a course project.
Along with the models, the repo also consists of ipynb files where I demonstrated use of these models. 
The demonstrations include Decision Boundary, Accuracy vs Different Hyperparameters and Confusion Matrix on both train and test data

## Classifiers in the repo
### Multivariate Gaussian Classifier
### KNN - K Nearest Neighbour
